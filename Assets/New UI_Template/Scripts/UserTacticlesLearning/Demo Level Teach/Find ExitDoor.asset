  description: Your ultimate goal is get out from this maze. The maze looks similar
    to every sides of the part. So its very difficult to find the exit door or memorize
    a part of the maze path. In order to tackle this problem, we have a sign placement
    method. With this feature you can place a sign boards one the wall or ground
    in order to know the already visited area or make a path to some destination.
    You can follow this method or find your own method to complete the level
